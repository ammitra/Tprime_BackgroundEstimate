The script `generate_autoMCstats.py` takes in the `organized_hists.root` file created by 2DAlphabet and produces per-year files containing histograms where every bin of the distribution is fixed except for one, which is varied up and down by the ttbar statistical uncertainty. The script also generates the required systematic descriptions for use in the JSON. 

NOTE: The JSON will describe a systematic uncertainty for EVERY bin in ALL REGIONS for ALL years of ttbar MC. This produces an insane number of systematics and Combine will be extremely unstable. Therefore I developed a script under `test_fit/parse_card.py` which takes the card generated by 2DAlphabet and removes the mcstats nuisances from the SR fail/pass and ttbarCR fail so that these systematics are present only for ttbar in the ttbarCR pass. After doing this the fits work well.
